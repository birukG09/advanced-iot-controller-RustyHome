### 🚀 Overview
**RustyHome** is an **advanced IoT control and simulation environment** built entirely in **Rust** — designed to model **smart home ecosystems**, **embedded controllers**, and **AI-driven automation systems**.  
It combines **systems programming**, **control theory**, and **IoT networking concepts** into one scalable project that can run as a **simulator**, a **lab testbed**, or evolve into a **real embedded firmware platform**.

This project serves as a foundation for exploring:
- **Next-generation control algorithms** (PID, MPC, adaptive control)
- **Edge AI for IoT**
- **Rust-based embedded firmware**
- **Hardware repurposing** — converting **old gaming consoles** into **home automation or control units**

|--------|--------------|
| 🏠 **Device Simulation Layer** | Models sensors (temperature, humidity, light, motion) and actuators (HVAC, lighting, security) with realistic state transitions |
| 🌐 **Virtual IoT Network** | Lightweight MQTT-like broker for inter-device communication |
| ⚙️ **Controller Core** | Implements advanced PID and rule-based logic for feedback control |
| 🔄 **Scheduler** | Real-time event loop that manages updates, triggers, and automation rules |
| 📈 **Telemetry Engine** | Logs simulation data in structured JSONL format for ML analysis |
| 🧠 **Extensible Rule Engine** | Supports event-driven automation scripts and intelligent decision logic |
| 🔬 **Algorithm Sandbox** | A module designed for testing new control, optimization, or AI algorithms |
| 💾 **Embedded-Ready Architecture** | Modularized codebase for future deployment on microcontrollers and SBCs |
| 🕹️ **Console Repurposing Plan** | Early-stage design for turning legacy game consoles (e.g., Xbox 2013) into IoT control hubs using Rust cross-compilation |

🔧 Module Breakdown

devices.rs — Simulates sensors/actuators

controller.rs — Core PID + control loop

network.rs — MQTT-like messaging between virtual nodes

scheduler.rs — Main runtime orchestration

telemetry.rs — JSON-based data persistence

🧩 Vision: Turning Consoles into Embedded Control Systems

“From gaming to governance — reimagining the console as a real-world controller.”
I plan to extend RustyHome to repurpose old gaming consoles (e.g., Xbox 2013) as embedded IoT hubs, creating:

Local real-time controllers for smart homes and labs

Edge compute nodes for running AI inference (Rust + ONNX Runtime)

A research platform for testing control, scheduling, and power optimization algorithms

A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for accessing GPU/CPU co-processing in console hardware

This direction merges:

Systems-level Rust programming

Control theory

Embedded computing

Artificial intelligence

🧮 Future Research & Extensions
Area	Description
🧠 AI Control Systems	Integrate neural networks for dynamic control adaptation
🕸️ Distributed IoT Mesh	Multi-node coordination using async networking
🧾 Formal Verification	Safety and stability verification of control logic
🧰 Hardware Integration	Embedded builds for Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and modded consoles

🧑‍💻 Development Philosophy

Secure, concurrent, and predictable — Rust is the backbone of modern control systems.

This project treats IoT not as a hobby, but as an operating system problem:
How can devices, control loops, and human commands coexist in a secure, deterministic, and efficient environment?

RustyHome is where those questions are explored — in pure Rust, with real systems mindset.
